## UX

### Website Goals

* Provide clear feedback and next steps to the users, so they find it easy to navigate through the game.
* Provide access to all the information related to the game, and links that are easily noticed. 
* Provide the same experience accessing the website from a browser or mobile.
* Make the website look credible and trustworthy.
* Provide the users with an engaging memory game, that would challenge the users memory and would catch their attention
    to want to spend more time on the website and improve their game timing.
* Provide information about the game rules with instructions on how to play the game. 
* Provide a contact form so individuals can get in contact with the team if they have any requests about the game or want 
    to report any issues.

### User Stories

* As a user, I want to see a game that is stimulating, enjoyable, and challenging.
* As a user, I want to be able to chose if I want the game to have any sounds or not. 
* As a user, I want to see a game that has warm colours, intuitive design. 
* As a user, I want to see a website that is easy to navigate.
* As a user, I want to see clear prompts, reactions, or next steps between levels. 
* As a user, I want to have the same experience accessing the website from a browser or mobile.
* As a user, I want to see instructions that would explain how to play the game.
* As a user, I want to see a contact page, so I can contact the owner if I have any questions, requests, or if I want to report
    an error I might encounter.

### Design Choices

* **Fonts chosen**: Open Sans and Source Sans Pro - as I want the text to be easy to read on all devices, provide a consistent 
    content through the game, and the main focus to be the game and not the fonts. I will also use 'Caesar Dressing' for the navigation
    title, as this font is the one used on the logo. 

* **Colours chosen**: I will use a combination of 4 colours across the website pages: teal, wheat, dark golden, and dark grey. 
    As I chose the theme of the website and game to be beach and cocktails related, I felt that these colours go well with the 
    theme of the website. 

    ![Colours combination](https://screenshot.click/16_02-cgr09-oithf.png)

    When the user selects the correct cards, or they fail to find the matching cards, there will be symbols showing up, ðŸ…‡ and âœ… ,
    which will be red and green. The respective cards border will also show these colours.  

    Colours were also chosen based on the [video game console palettes list from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_game_console_palettes#NES).

* **Layout chosen**: intuitive, easy to navigate, with a menu available on the main page, a back button on each page, that would 
    bring the user on the main, front page. Buttons and links will have a hover effect, that will allow the user to know an action 
    was taken when the buttons and links are clicked. The logo will also provide a link to the main page, in case the user would like
    to access the main page easily. 


### Wireframes

As part of the development process I created  wireframes for my website using the [Balsamiq tool](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/desktop/#). 
Some of the details that show on the wireframes were changed during the process of building the website because ... reasons. 
* These changes are:
    * eg1
    * eg2

* This is the [**PDF version with all the wireframes**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17jDVXZscPY018-Hd0jZA3--5V9EcGl6N?usp=sharing).
* This is the [**.png mobile version of the wireframes**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lv1h_QryJDawWz8sIOwqZzUiDFIAQz7j/view?usp=sharing).
* This is the [**.png desktop version of the wireframes**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xpHnrqGE-_osz59l_Gr4S-JsJgNrLlp9/view?usp=sharing).
* This is the [**.png tablet version of the wireframes**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1D8uzYeD0F7PvLSppVLPF4wvF_8KIMQ90/view?usp=sharing).
* These wireframes are also stored in the [wireframes directory](https://github.com/anabear/Huzzah/blob/379c2c204cdabe477d40b0100d479ace171701a1/wireframes).
